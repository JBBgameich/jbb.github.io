I'm happy to announce the first release of FutureSQL,
a library for accessing SQLite (and other databases) in Qt projects without blocking.

It also features a migration system and automatic result deserialization.

For examples, please have a look at the [README](https://invent.kde.org/libraries/futuresql).

You can fetch the release from [KDE's download server](https://download.kde.org/stable/futuresql/).
It is signed with my PGP key `C3D7CAFBF442353F95F69F4AA81E075ABEC80A7E`, which you can fetch from [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=C3D7CAFBF442353F95F69F4AA81E075ABEC80A7E).

Please let me know if you find any issues.
